graphing program for the browser. <br>
for now uses [math.js](https://mathjs.org/), but may everntually contain its own equasion parser.

Features:
- infinite grid
- grid upscaling and downscaling
  - Currently 2 issues:
  - JS *really* doesn't want to properly round 0 to 0
  - Scaling gets slower/faster as you zoom in/out (hard to fix due to limitations of JS)
- Simple graphing functionality (of one-sided equations)
